    "\n",
    "In this project you will create a git repository and share it with your classmates and instructors.  This repository will be used for the remainder of the course to turn in all course related documents. The following is a recommended folder structure for you Project:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```ProjectName``` - The top level folder is the name of your project. Give your project a short and memerable name. An ideal name should have meaning to people who may be interested in using your software. A poor name only has meaning to you. For example, eventhough past students chose to use CMSE802 as the name for their repository this name has zero meaning for anyone but the author of the software.  \n",
    "    * ```README.md``` - This is a description of your git repository written in Markdown.  This file will include a detailed description of your project and how to get started using it.  For now, you can just include your project description from your proposal.  For most people this will end up being their final project report. \n",
    "    * ```Models``` - This is a folder that will contain your bi-weekly model reports.  For now you can just include the reports we have already submitted to D2L.  For the rest of the class you will be submitting your model reports in this directory. \n",
    "    * ```doc``` - This folder is where you will include documentation for your project.  For now put a copy of your project proposal in this folder. \n",
    "        * ```images``` - Often the ```doc``` folder has a sub folder for images. Include this folder if/when you need to include images in your documentation such as your ```README.md``` file. \n",
    "    * ```mysourcename``` - This folder is where you will include your python source files (.py files). The name of this folder will depend on how you will want your users to \"import mysourcename\" your software package. Often the name of this folder will be exactly the same name as ```ProjectName```.   \n",
    "        * ```__init__.py``` - Include this file (it can be empty) to let Python know that this folder will become a Python Package. \n",
    "        * **Source_Files.py** - If you already have source files (.py files) put them here.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    * ```.gitignore``` - There are a lot of files that are inappropriate to include in a git repository (more information below) the \"Git Ignore\" file helps by telling Git that you never want to use these files.  There are plenty of examples for good ```.gitignore``` files for Python projects on the Internet.  Try to include one that makes sense (you can update it as the semester goes on).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "The above is a little hard to read. Here is the structure again without the explanation text:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ProjectName\n",

    "        Models\n",

    "# Files NOT to include in your repository\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not want to bloat the repository with unwanted files.  The git repository works best with Text files that represent \"source\" code and not compiled or generated code. Here are some basic guidelines of what not to include:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```.ipynb_checkpoint``` - These folders are generated when you run jupyter notebooks.  They are \"temporary\" compiled folders that will change each time you run your notebook and should not be included in your repository. \n",
    "* ```__pychache__``` - Similar to .ipynb_checkpoint folders these folders are often generated when running python scripts and should not be included in your repository. \n",
    "* **_Other \"Temporary\" files_** - Temporary files are generated by all types of software and often start with a special characters such as the dot (.) or the tilde (~).  For example many text editors generate temporary files to save a document in case of a program crash.  Do not include temporary files in your repository. \n",
    "* **_Compiled Code_** - Programs such as C and FORTRAN must compile their code to an executable in order to run on your computer. These compiled codes are not editable and should be left out of your repository.  Instead it is better to include instructions for compiling the source code as part of your repository.  \n",
    "* **_Program Output_** - Do not include any program output in your repository (unless for very specific reasons such as documentation, testing, or figures in your final report).  Assume that any output that can be generated by the source code should not be included with the source code (it is redundant). \n",
    "\n",
    "A good rule of thumb is that if you did not generate the file and/or do not know what it is you probably do NOT want to include it in your repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other files to avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the above files it is good to avoid any type of \"Binary\" file (with a few exceptions).  As stated early, git works best with text files so it can easily track changes. Some example binary files to avoid include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **_Large Data files_**  Although it is good to include a few example inputs to your software, avoid using entire datasets.  It is best to store these files someplace else.  \n",
    "- **_Non-Text formats_** such as Word, Excel or PowerPoint documents should be avoided.  These tend to change each time they are opened even if the core text does not change. it is better to use an alternative text example. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Note:_** one exception to the above rules are image files (ex jpg or png) that are used to help markdown or in the documentation.  It is typically okay to include these since they tend to get included only once and do not change much as the project evolves. "

    "\n",
    "When you name all of the files and folders inside of a repository, it is important that your names **_DO NOT include spaces_**.  Although all modern computer's have ways to accept names with spaces do not use them.  Instead use underscores (_) or ```CamleCase``` (No spaces and capital letters at the beginning of each word in the name).  Avoiding spaces in your names will **_ALWAYS_** save time in the long run.

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Relative paths typically start with a single dot (.), representing the currecnt directory, or two double dots (..) representing the current directories parent folder.\n",

    "\n",
    "Turns out that Jupyter notebook files and git repositories work very poorly together.  Jupyter notebook files are a unique combination of source and program generated information.  So, everytime you run a jupyter file it can add output cells which make git think you you changed something important. In many cases it is just a few numbers or some output text.  When you run the ```git status``` command it always looks like jupyter notebook files have changed even when they have not changed. \n",
